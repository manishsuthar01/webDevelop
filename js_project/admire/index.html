                <div class="content-text">
                    <p>Born on December 22, 1887, in the small town of Erode, Tamil Nadu, Srinivasa Ramanujan
                        emerged
                        from the most humble of beginnings to become one of history's most extraordinary
                        mathematical
                        minds. His story is not just one of genius, but of unwavering determination against
                        overwhelming
                        odds.</p>

                    <p>Growing up in a poor family, Ramanujan's formal education was constantly interrupted by
                        financial
                        hardship. Yet, this never dimmed his passion for numbers. With just a single textbook –
                        Carr's
                        Synopsis of Pure Mathematics – he embarked on a self-taught journey that would revolutionize
                        mathematics forever.</p>

                    <p>What moves me most about his early years is how he found infinite beauty in the language of
                        mathematics, even when the world around him offered little support. Working as a clerk to
                        support his family, he continued his mathematical explorations in solitude, covering slate
                        after
                        slate with equations that would later astound the world's greatest mathematicians.</p>

                <div class="content-text">
                    <p>Ramanujan's mathematical intuition was nothing short of miraculous. Without formal training
                        in
                        higher mathematics, he independently rediscovered centuries of Western mathematics and went
                        far
                        beyond, creating entirely new fields of study.</p>

                    <p>His collaboration with G.H. Hardy at Cambridge University became one of the most celebrated
                         partnerships in mathematical history. Hardy, initially skeptical of the strange formulas
                        arriving from India, soon recognized that he was witnessing mathematical genius of the
                        highest
                        order.</p>

                    <p>Ramanujan's notebooks, filled with over 3,000 theorems and formulas, continue to yield new
                        insights even today. His work on infinite series, number theory, partition functions, and
                        continued fractions opened entirely new avenues of mathematical research.</p>

                    <h3>Infinite Series</h3>
                    <p>Ramanujan discovered remarkable infinite series for π that converge with extraordinary speed,
                        some of which are still used in modern computer calculations.</p>

                <div class="math-card">
                    <h3>Partition Function</h3>
                    <p>His work on partition functions revealed deep patterns in how numbers can be broken down,
                        leading
                        to breakthroughs in analytic number theory.</p>

                    <h3>Mock Theta Functions</h3>
                    <p>These mysterious functions, discovered by Ramanujan, remained enigmatic for decades until
                        their
                        true significance was finally understood.</p>

            <h2 class="section-title">Why I Admire Ramanujan</h2>
            <div class="personal-section">
                <div class="personal-content">
                    <p style="font-size: 1.3rem; line-height: 1.8; margin-bottom: 2rem;">What I truly adore about
                        Ramanujan is his ability to see beauty in numbers where others saw only complexity. His
                        journey
                        from a small village in India to the hallowed halls of Cambridge represents everything I
                        believe
                        about the power of passion and perseverance.</p>

                    <p style="font-size: 1.3rem; line-height: 1.8; margin-bottom: 2rem;">When I face challenges in
                        my
                        own life, I think of Ramanujan working by candlelight, his slate covered with equations that
                        would change mathematics forever. He didn't have access to vast libraries or prestigious
                        institutions, yet he reached heights that formally trained mathematicians couldn't imagine.
                        This
                        teaches me that genius isn't about where you start – it's about how deeply you're willing to
                        dive into your passion.</p>

                    <p style="font-size: 1.3rem; line-height: 1.8; margin-bottom: 2rem;">His collaboration with
                        Hardy
                        also shows me the beauty of intellectual humility and cross-cultural exchange. Despite his
                        extraordinary abilities, Ramanujan remained eager to learn and grow. He reminds me that true
                        greatness comes not from knowing everything, but from never losing the wonder and curiosity
                        that
                        drives us to discover more.</p>

                    <p style="font-size: 1.3rem; line-height: 1.8;">Most importantly, Ramanujan's story tells me
                        that
                        the universe has patterns and beauty waiting to be discovered by anyone willing to look
                        deeply
                        enough. His legacy continues to inspire mathematicians today, proving that one person's
                        dedication to truth and beauty can echo through eternity.</p>
