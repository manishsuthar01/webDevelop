Pressing helps the tofu become firmer, allowing it to absorb flavors better and crisp up when cooked. \n How to press it: \n Tofu press method: Place the tofu block in a tofu press, tighten, and let it sit for 15–20 minutes. \n Manual method: Wrap tofu in a clean kitchen towel or a few paper towels. Place it on a plate and set something heavy on top (like a skillet or a book). Let it press for 15–20 minutes.Pro tip: The longer you press, the better the texture—especially for stir-fries or pan-frying",
