    <h2>Every JavaScript object has an internal link to another object called its prototype. This link is accessible
        through the __proto__ property.</h2>
    <p>When you try to access a property or method on an object, JavaScript looks:
        <br>
        First in the object itself.
        <br>
        Then in its __proto__ (i.e., its prototype).
        <br>
        Then in that prototype’s prototype… and so on (this is called the prototype chain).
    </p>

        let person = {
            name: 'Manish'

        console.log(person.toString())

        let animal = {
            eats: true
        };

        let rabbit = {  
            jumps: true
        };

        rabbit.__proto__ = animal;

        console.log(rabbit.eats); // true (from animal)
        console.log(rabbit.jumps); // true (from rabbit)

        console.log(animal.hasOwnProperty('jump'))
