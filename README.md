This repository is a comprehensive collection of my web development projects, learning exercises, and code snippets. It showcases a wide range of skills in front-end development, from building complete websites and games to practicing fundamental concepts in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Projects Showcase

This repository contains several standalone projects, each demonstrating different aspects of web development.

| Project | Description | Technologies |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **E-commerce Site** | A fully responsive front-end for a modern online clothing store, complete with product grids, promotional banners, and a detailed footer. | `HTML`, `CSS` |
| **ClicktoCook** | A dynamic recipe website that fetches data from a local JSON file. It features recipe categories, detailed instruction pages, and affiliate links for kitchen tools. | `HTML`, `CSS`, `JavaScript (JSON, DOM)` |
| **DIPAK Affiliate Site** | An affiliate marketing website for tech products. It dynamically loads product information, categories, and details from JSON files. | `HTML`, `CSS`, `JavaScript (JSON, DOM)` |
| **Flappy Bird Clone** | A functional clone of the classic Flappy Bird game, built with HTML Canvas and vanilla JavaScript, including audio effects. | `HTML`, `CSS`, `JavaScript`, `Canvas` |
| **Bubble Game** | An interactive game where the player scores points by clicking on numbered bubbles against a running timer. | `HTML`, `CSS`, `JavaScript` |
| **To-Do App** | A polished to-do list application that allows users to add, delete, and filter tasks. The app uses `localStorage` to persist data across sessions. | `HTML`, `CSS`, `JavaScript` |
| **Login System** | A simple but functional login and registration system that uses `localStorage` to manage user credentials. | `HTML`, `CSS`, `JavaScript` |
| **GSAP Animations**| A collection of small projects demonstrating the GreenSock Animation Platform (GSAP), including a custom cursor, scrolling text, and scroll-triggered animations. | `GSAP`, `HTML`, `CSS`, `JavaScript` |
| **Calculator** | A classic digital calculator with a clean interface and support for basic arithmetic operations. | `HTML`, `CSS`, `JavaScript` |

## Learning & Practice Files

The repository is also a rich resource of learning materials and practice code organized by technology.

*   **HTML (`/2HTML`, `/HTML_PRACTISE`)**: A collection of files demonstrating fundamental HTML tags, including forms, tables, lists, semantic elements, and media.

*   **CSS (`/CSS`, `/CSS_Tailwind`)**: Contains examples covering core CSS concepts such as the box model, Flexbox, Grid, positioning, animations, media queries, and utility-based styling with Tailwind CSS.

*   **JavaScript (`/Java_Script`, `/js_DOM`, `/js_interview`)**: An extensive library of scripts covering:
    *   **Core Concepts**: Variables, data types, operators, arrays, objects, functions, loops, and control flow.
    *   **Advanced Topics**: Promises, `async/await`, closures, prototypes, classes, inheritance, and ES6+ features.
    *   **DOM Manipulation**: Selectors, traversal, event handling, and dynamic styling.
    *   **Interview Prep**: Solutions for common JavaScript interview questions like string reversal, Fibonacci, and factorials.

## Technologies Used

*   **HTML5**
*   **CSS3** (Flexbox, Grid, Animations, Responsive Design)
*   **JavaScript (ES6+)**
*   **GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform)** for animations.
*   **HTML Canvas** for 2D games.

## Getting Started

To view any of the projects or examples, clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/manishsuthar01/webdevelop.git
```

Navigate into the cloned directory and open the `index.html` file of the desired project folder in your web browser.

**Note:** Some projects (e.g., `clicktocook`, `dipak`) use the `fetch` API to load local JSON data. To run these correctly, you may need to use a local server to avoid Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) errors. A simple way to do this is with the "Live Server" extension in Visual Studio Code.
